# This file must be at the ROOT of your GitHub repository.

# The 'source' field tells App Hosting where to find the actual
# application code (where your package.json and Next.js project lives).
# Since your Next.js app is inside 'codelab-friendlyeats-web', we specify that here.

# The 'buildCommand' specifies the command to execute to build your Next.js application.

# components generated by your Next.js build. For Next.js, this is usually '.next'.
